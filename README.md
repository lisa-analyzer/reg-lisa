# REGLiSA: a static analyzer for the REG language

REGLiSA is a static analyzer for programs written in the REG language, based on [LiSA](https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/lisa/). It builds the control flow graph of a `.reg` program and performs abstract interpretation-based analysis over it.

## REG Language Syntax

### ðŸ§± Statements

- **Assignment**  
  `var := expr;`  
  Assigns the result of `expr` to `var`.

- **Conditional**  
  - `( condition ? ; statement )` Executes `statement` only if `condition`
  - `( condition ? )` Terminates the program if `condition` is false

- **Loop**  
  `( condition ? ; statement )* ;`  
  Repeats `statement` as long as the `condition` is true.

- **Sequence**  
  `statement1 ; statement2`  
  Executes statements in order.

- **Skip**  
  `skip;`  
  No operation, that is the smallest program that does nothing.

### âž— Expressions

- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-` , `*`
  Operate on integer values.

- **Comparison**: `<`, `<=`, `=`  
  Used in conditionals.

- **Boolean**: `!` (negation), `&` (conjunction)
  Applied to boolean expressions.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All __non-terminal__ statements end with a semicolon (`;`).
- Parentheses are used to group conditionals and loop bodies.

### ðŸ“œ Example

This code calculates the sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers from 0 to 9.

```reg
n := 0;
even := 0;
odd := 1;

(
    n < 10 ? ;
    (
        y := n;

        (
            !(y <= 1)? ;
                y := y - 2
        )* ;

        (
            (y = 0)? ;
                even := even + n
        );
        (
            (y = 1) ? ;
                odd := odd * n
        );

        n := n + 1
    )
)*
```

---

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- Gradle 8.0 or higher

To build the analyzer:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

This produces a JAR file in `build/libs`.

---

## Usage

The analyzer is executed via command line, passing the `.reg` file as the only argument:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/reg-lisa.jar path/to/file.reg
```

---

## Example

```bash
java -jar build/libs/reg-lisa.jar reglisa-testcases/runtime.reg
```

There's already a run configuration in the project for IntelliJ IDEA, which can be used to run the analyzer on a `.reg` file.
By default, it runs the `runtime.reg` file, but this can be changed in the run configuration.
The same is true for the tests, which can be run using the run configuration for JUnit.
